<h1>Number Guessing Game</h1>
<br>
For a <b>Number Guessing Game</b> project built in <b>Java</b>, the goal is to create a simple console-based game where the program randomly generates a number, and the user has to guess it. The program will provide feedback on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct, and track the number of attempts made by the user.

  <li><h3>Java Classes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>NumberGuessingGame: </b> – Core class that handles the game logic, including generating the random number, accepting user guesses, and providing feedback.</li>
      <li><b>Main: </b>– The entry point of the program that initializes and runs the game.</li>
    </ul>
